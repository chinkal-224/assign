 Iâ€™m excited to present my final project, Allora â€“ a wellness and mood-tracking application that Iâ€™ve built as part of my Full Stack Developer training at Upflairs.

During this training, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience with both frontend and backend development. Iâ€™ve worked through weekly assignments, learned to collaborate, solve
real-world problems, and finally created this full-stack project from scratch.ğŸŒ ğŸŒ ğŸŒ ğŸŒ ğŸŒ
