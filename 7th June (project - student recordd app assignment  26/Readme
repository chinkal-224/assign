📘 Assignment: Student Records API with Express & Mongoose

🎯 Objective:
Build a backend CRUD API to manage student records using Express.js and MongoDB (with Mongoose).

📝 Requirements:
Create an Express.js application with the following features:

📦 Student Schema (Mongoose):
- name: String (required)
- rollNo: Number (required, unique)
- courses: [String] (at least 1)
- GPA: Number (0.0 - 4.0)

🛠️ API Endpoints:

1. 📥 Create a new student
   - Method: POST
   - Route: `/api/students`
   - Body: `{ name, rollNo, courses, GPA }`

2. 📄 Get all students
   - Method: GET
   - Route: `/api/students`

3. 🔍 Get a student by roll number
   - Method: GET
   - Route: `/api/students/:rollNo`

4. ✏️ Update a student by roll number
   - Method: PUT
   - Route: `/api/students/:rollNo`
   - Body: Any updatable fields (name, courses, GPA)

5. ❌ Delete a student by roll number
   - Method: DELETE
   - Route: `/api/students/:rollNo`

✅ Bonus Tasks:
- Add validation to ensure GPA is between 0.0 and 4.0
- Sort students by GPA in descending order when fetching all
- Implement pagination using `?page=1&limit=10`
